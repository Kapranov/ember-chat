# EmberConf Chat

This is a demonstration application to accompany my talk entitled "Building Real-time Applications in Ember", which I will be giving on March 4, 2015 at [EmberConf][] in Portland, Oregon.

We'll be working with two branches:

* [websocket-controller](https://github.com/stevekinney/emberconf-chat/tree/websocket-controller)
* [websocket-server](https://github.com/stevekinney/emberconf-chat/tree/websocket-service)

[EmberConf]: http://emberconf.com/ "EmberConf 2015"

This project relies on [stevekinney/socketry-server][server] and is loosely based on [stevekinney/socketry-client][client], which I used in an earlier version of this talk given at Denver Ember.js in November of 2014.

[server]: https://github.com/stevekinney/socketry-server
[client]: https://github.com/stevekinney/socketry-client
[denver]: http://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Denver/events/215907412/

Other Examples:
* [Ember chat with NodeJS and Redis](https://github.com/beydogan/ember-chat.git)
* [Chat backend with socket.io, redis and node.js](https://github.com/beydogan/simple-chat.git)
